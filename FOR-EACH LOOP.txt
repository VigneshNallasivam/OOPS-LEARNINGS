//FOR-EACH LOOP /ENHANCED LOOP




                                                               FOR-EACH LOOP /ENHANCED LOOP
															   ============================
- It is known as the for-each loop because it traverses each element one by one.
- It is mainly used to traverse the array or collection elements.
- The advantage of the for-each loop is that it eliminates the possibility of bugs and makes the code more readable. 

ADVANTAGES:-
===========
-> It makes the code more readable.
-> It eliminates the possibility of programming errors.

DISADVANTAGES:-
==============
-> Cannot traverse the elements in reverse order. 
-> No possibility of Sorting Elements.
-> Cannot traverse the odd or even elements.
-> you do not have the option to skip any element because it does not work on an index basis.
-> Cannot process two decision making statements at once. 

Syntax:-
--------
for (Data-type  VariableName : Array/CollectionName) 
{
  //Code Block
}

Example:-
---------
//SIMPLE FOR-EACH LOOP EXECUTION USING ARRAY-LIST
import java.util.ArrayList;
public class Sample
{
	void fruits()
	{
		ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>(); 
		list.add("Apple");
		list.add("Banana");
		list.add("Grapes");
		list.add("Orange");
		list.add("Strawberry");
		System.out.println(list);
		
		for(String fruits:list)
		{
			System.out.println(fruits);
		}
		
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Sample obj = new Sample();
		System.out.println("The Fruits Are :");
		obj.fruits();
	}
}
OUTPUT>>
--------
The Fruits Are :
[Apple, Banana, Grapes, Orange, Strawberry]
Apple
Banana
Grapes
Orange
Strawberry
