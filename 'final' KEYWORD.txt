		                                                              'final' KEYWORD
																	  ===============
-The 'final' keyword in java is used to restrict the user
-'final' keyword makes them non-changeable (impossible to inherit or override)
-The final keyword is useful when you want a variable to always store the same value
-The final keyword is called a "modifier".
-Using the final keyword means that the value can't be modified in the future.
-Classes marked as final can't be extended i.e cannot be inherited
-A final variable that is not initialized at the time of declaration is known as blank final variable.It can be initialized only in constructor.
-final method is inherited but you cannot override it
-If you make any class as final, you cannot extend it.
-Final can be:
         variable =>Final Variable
          method  =>Final Method (can be inherited but cannot override it)
           class  =>Final Class (cannot be inherited)
		   
		                                                             1.'final' VARIABLE
																	 ==================

Example:-
--------
class Bike
{  
  final int speedlimit=90;                            //final variable  
  void run()
  {  
    speedlimit=400;  
  } 
  
 public static void main(String args[])
 {  
 Bike obj=new  Bike();  
 obj.run();  
 }  
}

																		  ================
Example:-
---------
class System

  final void run()                             //final Method
  {
   System.out.println("running.....");
  }  
}  
     
class Computer extends Bike
{  
   void run()
   {
    System.out.println("running 0.5mbps");
   }  
     
   public static void main(String args[])
   {
